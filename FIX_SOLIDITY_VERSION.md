# 🔧 Fix Solidity Version Compatibility

## ❌ **Error Encountered**
```
Error HH606: The project cannot be compiled, see reasons below.
The Solidity version pragma statement in these files doesn't match any of the configured compilers in your config.

* @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol (^0.8.20)
* @openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol (^0.8.20)
* @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol (^0.8.20)

These files and its dependencies cannot be compiled with your config:
* contracts/U2UBridge.sol
* contracts/WETH.sol
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Updated Hardhat Configuration**
- Changed Solidity version from `0.8.19` to `0.8.20` in `hardhat.config.js`

### **2. Updated Contract Files**
- Updated `contracts/WETH.sol`: `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;`
- Updated `contracts/U2UBridge.sol`: `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;`
- Updated `contracts/SepoliaBridge.sol`: `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;`

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy**

Now run the deployment commands:

```bash
# Deploy to U2U Solaris Mainnet
npx --yes hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network u2u

# Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
npx --yes hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

**Or use the deployment script:**
```bash
./deploy-bridge.sh
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

The deployment should now proceed successfully:

```
Starting deployment...
Deploying contracts with account: 0x[your-address]
Account balance: [balance] U2U

=== Deploying WETH Contract ===
WETH deployed to: 0x[weth-address]

=== Deploying U2U Bridge ===
U2U Bridge deployed to: 0x[u2u-bridge-address]

=== Setting Bridge in WETH Contract ===
Bridge set in WETH contract

=== Deployment Summary ===
{
  "networks": {
    "u2u": {
      "chainId": 39,
      "name": "U2U Solaris Mainnet",
      "bridgeAddress": "0x[u2u-bridge-address]",
      "wethAddress": "0x[weth-address]",
      "rpcUrl": "https://rpc-mainnet.u2u.xyz",
      "blockExplorer": "https://u2uscan.xyz"
    }
  }
}
```

## 📋 **What Was Fixed**

- **OpenZeppelin Compatibility**: Updated to use Solidity `^0.8.20` to match OpenZeppelin contracts
- **Hardhat Configuration**: Updated compiler version in `hardhat.config.js`
- **Contract Files**: Updated pragma statements in all contract files
- **Deployment Script**: Ready to deploy with correct Solidity version

The Solidity version compatibility issue has been resolved! 🎉
