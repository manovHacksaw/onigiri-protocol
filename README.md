# Pocket Protocol - Cross-Chain DeFi Platform

**A revolutionary cross-chain DeFi platform that enables seamless token swapping, bridging, and staking between Rootstock and Ethereum networks with real-time market data integration.**

## üìã Project Description

Pocket Protocol is a comprehensive decentralized finance platform that bridges the gap between Rootstock and Ethereum ecosystems. We've integrated Rootstock's native tRBTC with Ethereum's wRBTC through an innovative cross-chain bridge system, enabling users to swap tokens, stake assets, and access real-time market data across both networks seamlessly.

**What we integrated Rootstock with and how:**

We integrated Rootstock Testnet with Ethereum Sepolia to create a unified cross-chain DeFi experience:

- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Built a sophisticated bridge system that allows users to transfer tRBTC from Rootstock Testnet to wRBTC on Ethereum Sepolia with automatic token minting
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deployed contracts on both Rootstock Testnet and Ethereum Sepolia for seamless cross-chain operations
- **Relayer System**: Implemented an automated relayer that processes bridge transactions and mints equivalent tokens on the destination chain
- **Real-time Integration**: Connected Pyth Network price feeds to provide live market data for both networks
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless wallet connection supporting both Rootstock and Ethereum networks

**Technical Implementation:**
- Rootstock Bridge Contract: `0x12FA616A8c8c5B892189743eCE97B97ca8360ac4`
- Ethereum Sepolia Bridge: `0xa870B2C67D6A957a40C528Eb96E8b7e51FbbD092`
- wRBTC Token: `0x25d6d8758FaB9Ae4310b2b826535486e85990788`

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Testnet tokens (tRBTC for Rootstock, ETH for Sepolia)
- Node.js 18+ installed

### Step-by-Step Testing Guide

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pocket-protocol
   cd pocket-protocol
   npm install
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   # Add your WalletConnect Project ID to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://1rpc.io/sepolia
   RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_relayer_private_key
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test Cross-Chain Bridge**
   - Connect wallet to Rootstock Testnet
   - Navigate to Bridge page
   - Enter amount of tRBTC to bridge
   - Confirm transaction
   - Verify wRBTC appears on Sepolia

5. **Test Token Swapping**
   - Switch between Rootstock and Sepolia networks
   - Use Swap page to exchange tokens
   - Verify real-time price updates

6. **Test Staking Protocol**
   - Navigate to Stake page
   - Stake RBTC tokens
   - Claim RIFF rewards
   - Verify cross-chain ETH minting

7. **Test Market Explorer**
   - Visit Explore page
   - Verify real-time price data
   - Test search functionality

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Successful bridge transactions on both networks
- ‚úÖ Real-time price updates from Pyth Network
- ‚úÖ Seamless wallet switching between networks
