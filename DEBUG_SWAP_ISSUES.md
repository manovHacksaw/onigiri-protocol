# 🔧 Debug Swap Issues

## 🐛 Issues Identified

1. **Wrong Action Branch**: The swap action wasn't being triggered (falling through to default)
2. **No Conversion**: It was sending raw U2U amount as ETH instead of converting
3. **Wrong Recipient**: Error shows sending to relayer's own address

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Action Detection**
- Removed `&& transferId` condition that was preventing swap action
- Added debugging logs to see which branch is taken

### 2. **Added Recipient Validation**
- Check if recipient is relayer's own address (shouldn't happen)
- Return clear error if this occurs

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added console logs to see what parameters are received
- Added branch indicators (✅ for swap, ❌ for default)

## 🚀 Test Now

Try your 0.5 U2U swap again and check the console logs. You should see:

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Relayer API called with: { recipient: "0x[user-address]", amount: "0.5", action: "swap", transferId: "0x[tx-hash]" }
✅ Processing swap: 0.5 U2U for 0x[user-address], transferId: 0x[tx-hash]
Current prices - U2U: $0.006144, ETH: $4327.95
Converting 0.5 U2U ($0.003) to 0.000007 ETH
```

### **If Still Broken, You'll See:**
```
❌ Using default behavior - action: swap, transferId: 0x[tx-hash]
```

## 🔍 What to Check

1. **Console Logs**: Look for the debugging messages
2. **Recipient**: Should be your wallet address, not relayer's
3. **Conversion**: Should show small ETH amount (~0.000007 ETH)

## 🛠️ If Still Not Working

The issue might be:
1. **Frontend not sending correct parameters**
2. **Relayer not receiving the request properly**
3. **Network/RPC issues**

Check the browser's Network tab to see the actual request being sent to `/api/relayer`.

The debugging logs will help identify exactly where the issue is occurring!
