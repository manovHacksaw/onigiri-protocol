# üîß Debug Quote Conversion Issue

## üêõ Issue Identified

When entering 0.5 U2U, the frontend shows 0.5 ETH instead of the converted amount (~0.00000071 ETH).

## ‚úÖ Debugging Added

Added console logs to track the quote calculation:

1. **fetchTokenPrice**: Shows what price is fetched for each token
2. **getSwapQuote**: Shows the conversion calculation

## üöÄ Test Now

1. **Go to `/swap` page**
2. **Enter 0.5 in the "You pay" field**
3. **Check browser console** for these messages:

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Fetching price for U2U: $0.006144
Fetching price for ETH: $4327.95
Quote calculation: 0.5 U2U @ $0.006144 ‚Üí ETH @ $4327.95
Rate: 0.00000142, To Amount: 0.00000071
```

### **If Broken, You'll See:**
```
Fetching price for U2U: $1
Fetching price for ETH: $1
Quote calculation: 0.5 U2U @ $1 ‚Üí ETH @ $1
Rate: 1, To Amount: 0.4975
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **If U2U price shows $1:**
- The token symbol "U2U" is not matching the MOCK_PRICES key
- Check if frontend is passing correct token symbol

### **If ETH price shows $1:**
- The token symbol "ETH" is not matching
- Check token symbol consistency

### **If rate is 1:**
- Both prices are the same ($1), indicating lookup failure

## üìä Expected Result

With correct prices:
- **0.5 U2U** √ó $0.006144 = $0.003072
- **$0.003072** √∑ $4327.95 = **0.00000071 ETH**

The "You receive" field should show **0.00000071** instead of **0.5**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

Based on console output:
1. **If prices are correct**: Check if the quote is being used properly in the UI
2. **If prices are wrong**: Fix the token symbol matching
3. **If no console output**: Check if quote function is being called

The debugging will show exactly where the conversion is failing!
