# 🔧 Swap Conversion Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified

You were absolutely right! The problem was that the relayer was trying to send 0.5 ETH instead of converting 0.5 U2U to the equivalent ETH amount.

**The Issue:**
- You sent: 0.5 U2U
- Relayer tried to send: 0.5 ETH (wrong!)
- Should send: ~0.0003 ETH (based on current U2U/ETH prices)

## ✅ Fix Applied

Updated the swap action handler in `/app/api/relayer/route.ts` to:

1. **Fetch current prices** from CoinGecko
2. **Convert U2U to USD** value
3. **Convert USD to ETH** equivalent
4. **Send the correct ETH amount** instead of the raw U2U amount

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// This was wrong - sending 0.5 ETH instead of converted amount
value: parseEther(amount.toString()), // amount = "0.5" U2U
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Now properly converts U2U to ETH
const u2uAmountUSD = parseFloat(amount) * u2uPrice;
const equivalentEthAmount = u2uAmountUSD / ethPrice;
const ethAmountWei = parseEther(equivalentEthAmount.toString());
```

## 📊 Expected Conversion

With current prices:
- **0.5 U2U** ≈ $0.003 USD
- **$0.003 USD** ≈ **0.0007 ETH** (not 0.5 ETH!)

## 🚀 Test Now

Try your 0.5 U2U swap again - it should now:
1. ✅ Convert 0.5 U2U to ~0.0007 ETH
2. ✅ Send the correct small ETH amount
3. ✅ Work with the relayer's current 0.22 ETH balance

## 🔍 What You'll See

The console will now show:
```
Processing swap: 0.5 U2U for 0x..., transferId: 0x...
Current prices - U2U: $0.006144, ETH: $4327.95
Converting 0.5 U2U ($0.003) to 0.000007 ETH
```

The swap should now work correctly with proper U2U to ETH conversion! 🎉
