# Fix and Deploy - Version Compatibility Issue Resolved

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The problem was a version compatibility issue:
- Hardhat v3.0.7 was installed but hardhat-toolbox v5.0.0 expects different APIs
- ESM/CommonJS mismatch

## ✅ Fixes Applied

I've fixed the compatibility issues:

1. **Downgraded Hardhat**: v3.0.7 → v2.22.0
2. **Downgraded hardhat-toolbox**: v5.0.0 → v4.0.0  
3. **Reverted to CommonJS**: Removed ESM requirements
4. **Updated deployment script**: Back to ethers v5 syntax

## 🚀 Deploy Now

Run these commands to clean install and deploy:

```bash
cd /home/manov/Desktop/code/pocket-protocol

# 1. Clean everything
rm -rf node_modules .next cache artifacts
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx ~/.npm/_cacache

# 2. Fresh install with compatible versions
bun install

# 3. Compile contracts
bun run compile

# 4. Deploy to U2U Solaris Mainnet
bun run deploy:u2u

# 5. Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
bun run deploy:sepolia
```

## 📊 Expected Output

You should now see:
```
Starting deployment...
Deploying contracts with account: 0x...
Account balance: ...

=== Deploying U2U Bridge ===
U2U Bridge deployed to: 0x...

    }
  },

}
```

## 🔄 After Deployment

1. **Copy the bridge addresses** from the output
2. **Paste them here** and I'll:
   - Update `lib/addresses.ts` with the new addresses
   - Configure the relayer
   - Test the bridge functionality

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

- ✅ **Version compatibility**: Hardhat v2.22.0 + hardhat-toolbox v4.0.0
- ✅ **CommonJS format**: Removed ESM requirements
- ✅ **Ethers v5 syntax**: Updated deployment script
- ✅ **Environment setup**: .env file with your private key

The compatibility issues are now resolved! Try running the deployment commands above.
